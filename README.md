# HomegenieEchoBridge
This program connects to the Homegenie API and gets a list of modules and then populates the bridge code with these and the necessary urls to control these via the homegenie api

Based on a fork of nanowebcoders c# port of Armzilla's JAVA version, located at https://github.com/nanowebcoder/NanoVeraHuesBridge and https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge

I have stripped back un-needed backwards compatibility and made it purely do what I need for my purposes at the moment.
